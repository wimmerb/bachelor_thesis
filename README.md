For my thesis at TU Munich I did an interactive jazz improvisation learning application. It visualises an instrument's pitch (or you can also click on the screen for synthesized playing) together with a visual represenation of the harmonic model underlying for a specific piece. The player is now able to improvise over a backing track and is visually aided in the choice of notes.

## Example
Here is a screenshot. For a more interesting demo, please download [**this video**](https://github.com/wimmerb/bachelor_thesis/blob/master/videos/screen_recording_small.mov)

## JUCE

This application is intended to be cross-platform for iOS, Android and MacOS, therefore
MidiSnapPad is built with the cross-platform framework [JUCE](https://juce.com/).
